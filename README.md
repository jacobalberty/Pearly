# Pearly
This is a framework I wrote for our client record management at work. It has a lot of features I find personally useful.

Right now this source code is a tech preview, no license is available so you really have no right to copy it downloading it to experiment with is fine however.

Expect lots of commits as I find more pieces to include, once I know all the pieces are on github and some documentation is in tact I will decide on a license, most likely license is lgpl or bsd license but for now no distribution allowed.
